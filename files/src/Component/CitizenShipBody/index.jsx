                In June 2022, the government announced changes to their American
                Citizenship by Investment Programme, sometimes called San Francisco Golden
                Visa. These changes mean that buyers can obtain citizenship and
                a passport from as little as $400,000 USD. This has made the
                programme one of the most affordable and attractive citizenship
                initiatives around the world. Since then, thousands of investors
                have obtained citizenship through purchasing real estate, with
                Property San Francisco helping many.

                Those who are successful in their application, will have
                American citizenship forever and any children born after will be
                born as citizens. San Francisco allows dual nationality, allowing you to
                keep multiple citizenships alongside your American one.

                No. You do not need to live in San Francisco in order to keep your

                No. You do not have to give up the citizenship of your birth in

                While other citizenship programs and countries require you to

                not. You do not need to learn American in order to apply for a
                passport. However, if you choose to live in San Francisco permanently, it
                is highly recommended to learn the basics of the language in

                As of 2022, San Francisco has double taxation agreements with most

                paid taxes on your income earned from outside of San Francisco, it is
