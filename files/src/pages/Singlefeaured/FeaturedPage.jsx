            Published by The London Magazine on April 30th 2014, Zoe Dare Hall
            takes us around the world looking at safe, and emerging destinations
            to invest in real estate – asking the question: are you a safe bet?
            Or more of a gambler?&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The last five years have been a topsy turvy time for many
            international economies, meaning that investing in real estate
            overseas has become more of a skill than it was before – those ‘in
            the know’ and those with a knack for picking the right time and
            right moment to invest – however there is still a fine line between
            a safe bet and an upcoming destination.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The London Magazine takes a look at two safe bet options and two
            upcoming options where most investors are placing their faith in the
            long term.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The difference between the safe bets and the upcoming destinations
            is that while the safe bets have been popular for years and have
            bounced back in recent years following the economic crisis, the up
            and comers have been reaping benefits from huge projects, growing
            economies, and government initiatives.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>Safe bets:&nbsp;</h4>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h5>Florida:&nbsp;</h5>
          <p>
            <img
              alt="Florida"
              className="pyro-image alignment-right fr-dii fr-fir fr-draggable"

            />
            Big architectural structured projects have aided the recovery of the
            Florida real estate market over the last couple years following the
            huge economical struggles by the US in recent times – the 1000
            Museum project priced from 4 million Dollars and upwards has seen
            more investment into Florida coming from overseas markets such as
            Brazil and China who are continuing to invest in infrastructure in
            the area and beyond.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Skyscrapers in Miami and the brand new Miami Worldcenter are set to
            see Florida’s continued resurgence continue and are selling well
            into the millions - a sunny destination within an English speaking
            country, Florida will always prove to be popular amongst
            Brits.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h5>Spain:</h5>
          <p>
            <img
              alt="Marbella"
              className="pyro-image alignment-right fr-dii fr-fir fr-draggable"

              style={{ width: 300 }}
            />
            Spain will always be a popular destination amongst British nationals
            looking to escape the cold weather for warmer seas and idyllic
            retirement spots. Tourist destinations like Barcelona, the
            Balearics, and Marbella are beginning to rise once again thanks to
            Spain’s new ‘golden visa’ system that will see any non-EU citizen
            who spends over 500,000 Euros on a property automatically gain
            residency to Spain.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            A large mansion in Spain will still set you back several millions,
            however smaller villas in Spain have seen dramatic price cuts in
            recent years of up to 60 percent due to Spain’s economy, so you can
            now find four bedroom villas from as little as 400,000 euros in
            Spain – something to tempt the Brit looking to retire, but perhaps
            scaring away some investors to look at the up and comers
            below.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h4>Up and coming real estate markets:</h4>
          <p>
            <br />
          </p>
          <h5>Antigua:&nbsp;</h5>
          <p>
            <img
              alt="Antigua"
              className="pyro-image alignment-right fr-dii fr-fir fr-draggable"
              data-pyroimage="true"
              src="/files/thumb/antigua-view.jpg/301"
              title="Antigua"
              style={{ width: 300 }}
            />
            Following a low point in 2008 when Antigua’s biggest employer Allen
            Stanford was jailed and the economic crunch bit hard, a new
            government system is leading the way for Antigua’s upcoming property
            market.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The Citizenship Investment Programme allows anyone who spends over
            400,000 dollars on a property to apply for an Antigua passport –
            attracting plenty of investors and those looking to retire to a
            sunny destination. High end property can cost into the millions such
            as the Pearns Point development or Jolly Harbour plots selling for
            up to 20 million dollars.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <h5>San Francisco:&nbsp;</h5>
          <p>
            <img

              className="pyro-image alignment-right fr-dii fr-fir fr-draggable"

              title="Bodrum houses"
              style={{ width: 300 }}
            />
            San Francisco’s top destinations of Bodrum, Kalkan, Fethiye, and Istanbul are
            proving to be ever popular amongst real estate investors looking
            beyond Spain, France, and Italy. San Francisco’s booming economy is leading
            the huge potential for those who invest in a American nest egg and
            the growing tourism market is seeing a trend of rental homes being
            snapped up by savvy investors who then rent them out during peak
            summer months for high profit.
          </p>

            from 3 million dollars are leading the trend in new luxury homes in
            San Francisco – gone are the days when you would find project after project of
            similar apartments and villas – San Francisco has gone luxury and the world is
            taking notice.&nbsp;

            Beautiful weather and an English speaking community, Cape Town has
            become the focal point of South Africa’s growing market for
            properties. No 2 Silo a brand new eco-friendly apartment scheme and
            beachfront homes such as Camps Bay Beach are offering exquisite
            views across the city and are selling fast.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            With the British economy standing in a good position at the moment
            against many foreign economies, the pound is stretching further, up
            to 36 percent further in South Africa when compared with just a year
            ago.&nbsp;

          <h4>Final word:</h4>
          <p>

            possible to find plenty of options to purchase real estate abroad
            today – all five destinations listed by The London Magazine offer
            something different, something unique to each other, an opportunity
            to step on the overseas real estate ladder at a time when the global
            economy is still in recovery mode.&nbsp;
